We Say: The GT Flyer 35 we tested boasted twin 300 hp Volvo Penta Duoprop sterndrives and achieved a top speed of 40.1 mph, cruised efficiently, and handled like a sports sedan. Credit Beneteau’s patented Air Step hull, which draws air from topside intakes and allows it to flow out over a pair of steps. The Air Step design has a pair of “aft runners” that hold the air under the hull all the way to the transom. This air cushion reduces friction but still allows a solid flow of water to reach the propellers. Meanwhile, the keel, forward-lifting strakes and aft runners hold the GT Flyers's hull firmly on track while underway.

The GT Flyer 35 shines as a day boat with overnight capabilities. Its double helm seat provides excellent sight lines. The arch, integral to the curvaceous windshield side wings, provides protection from wind blast while allowing in the sun. Aft is a full galley, a U-shaped dinette, and a bench that converts to a sun lounge. A full-length rail makes it safe going to the forward sun pad. A huge swim platform completes the outdoor facilities.

Belowdecks, the master cabin lies athwartships beneath the helm, with a head to port opposite a hanging locker and sink. Forward, the dinette converts to a V-berth. Fit and finish are excellent, with cabinetwork a highlight.

Who’d Want One: Day boaters seeking to please a crowd.

Another Choice: Cobalt’s 336 ($247,690 with twin 300 hp MerCruiser sterndrives).

Bottom Line: $299,150 (with test power); beneteauamerica.com
