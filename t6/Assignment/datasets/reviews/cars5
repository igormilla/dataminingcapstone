Vehicle Details

 Dashboard, center console, gear shifter view photo
Open the door and you'll find the 2014 Chrysler 300's interior to be a place of luxury, style, elegance, comfort and technology. For the senses, there are soft surfaces, attractive back-lit instrumentation and a thick-rimmed steering wheel that's perfect for serious motoring. The seats are supportive for long trips and hold the occupants in place when the road rapidly changes direction. Add some luxury options, and enjoy a leather-stitched instrument panel cover, 2-tone leather upholstery and heated and cooled 12-way front power seats.

Exterior
  photo
There are few more distinctive and purposeful-looking big 4-door sedans than the 2014 Chrysler 300. In front is a big chrome grille that practically defines the meaning of bold, in back are artful taillights, and it all fits into a familiar shape, with a robust lower form and the slightly-small windows of the slightly-lowered roofline, that is not shy about its identity. Details include chrome air-intake outlines and LED daytime running lights. And even the most "base" model looks good, with tasteful chrome trim and 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels.

Notable Standard Equipment
Standard equipment for the 2014 Chrysler 300 includes keyless entry and start, a big 8.4-inch touchscreen with climate and music controls, Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, USB/iPod/SD card connectivity, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather seating, a 12-way power driver's seat with 4-way power lumbar support, tilt/telescopic steering wheel, cruise control, heated front seats, 17-inch painted aluminum wheels, one-touch up/down windows all around and a full complement of active and passive safety features including side-curtain airbags, driver's-knee airbag, hill-start assist and electronic stability control.

Notable Optional Equipment
The 2014 Chrysler 300 is offered with some interesting option packages. The 300C John Varvatos Limited Edition brings high style, the 300C John Varvatos Luxury Edition loads up the luxury and the 300S with Beats by Dr. Dre is for the audiophile. All the packages are aimed at Chrysler's "Imported from Detroit" tagline. Other major options include all-wheel drive, a variety of safety-oriented electronic aids, and upgraded audio systems.

Under the Hood
For a "base" engine, it's tough to beat the 2014 Chrysler 300's 3.6-liter Pentastar V6, with 292 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 300S trim level has cold-air induction and makes 300 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque. Both V6 engines have an excellent 8-speed automatic transmission. The 5.7-liter Hemi V8 makes 363 horsepower and 394 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.4-liter Hemi in the SRT8 cranks out 470 horsepower, 470 lb-ft of torque, and a level of performance that will definitely get your attention. The Hemi engines are fitted with a 5-speed automatic with AutoStick manual-shift function.

Pricing Notes
The very well-equipped 2014 Chrysler 300 has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of around $31,000. Add lots of options and the price can reach the region of $50,000 for a fully-loaded 300C AWD. The go-real-fast SRT8 starts around $50,000. To make your best deal, be sure to check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price, which shows what others in your area are paying for the 300. The 2014 Chrysler 300 is strong on price and product, but takes a hit on resale values. However, Chrysler often has a number of incentives and rebates that can significantly reduce the actual transaction price, so be sure to check what is being offered. As for resale, we expect the 2014 Chrysler 300 to hold average 5-year projected residual values, falling well below the Toyota Avalon and Hyundai Genesis, but nearly on par with the Ford Taurus and Buick LaCrosse.
